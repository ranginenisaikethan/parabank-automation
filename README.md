Perfect 👍 Let’s create a **professional README.md** for your ParaBank Automation Project that you can drop directly into GitHub. It will explain the project, structure, setup, execution, CI/CD, and reporting.

# ParaBank Automation Testing Framework

This repository contains a **Selenium + TestNG + Page Object Model (POM)** based automation framework for testing the [ParaBank](https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm) demo banking application.  

It validates critical banking workflows such as login, balance updates, fund transfers, loan requests, and transaction history.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Java + Selenium WebDriver** for UI automation  
- **TestNG** for test management, assertions, and reporting  
- **Page Object Model (POM)** for clean separation of test logic and UI locators  
- **Maven** build and dependency management  
- **Properties Config** to manage environment (URL, browser, credentials, timeouts)  
- **Jenkinsfile** for CI/CD integration with Jenkins  
- **Cross-browser support** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)  
- **Parameterized tests** using TestNG DataProviders  
- **HTML reports** (TestNG + ExtentReports if configured)

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parabank-automation.git
   cd parabank-automation
````

2. **Install dependencies (Maven required)**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Update configuration** in `config.properties`:

   ```properties
   app.url=https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm
   browser=chrome
   test.username=john
   test.password=demo
   implicit.wait=5
   explicit.wait=10
   page.load.timeout=20
   ```

---

## ▶️ Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

Run with TestNG suite:

```bash
mvn clean test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml
```

Run a specific test class:

```bash
mvn -Dtest=LoginTests test
```

Run with parameters (example for browser):

```bash
mvn test -Dbrowser=firefox
```

---

## 📊 Reports

* TestNG default HTML reports → `test-output/`
* ExtentReports (if integrated) → `reports/`

Open `test-output/index.html` in a browser to view execution results.

---

## 🎥 Demo & Usage

* **Step 1:** Login with test credentials (`john/demo`)
* **Step 2:** Navigate to Accounts Overview, Transfer Funds, Request Loan, or Find Transactions
* **Step 3:** Automated tests validate:

  * Balance updates after transactions
  * Loan approval/rejection logic
  * Transfers with edge cases (negative, invalid, exceeding balance)
  * Transaction history (search, pagination, sorting)

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Add API testing for ParaBank REST endpoints
* Add Dockerized Selenium Grid for parallel execution
* Add BDD layer with Cucumber for business-readable test cases
* Extend coverage to Bill Pay, Open New Account, and Update Profile flows

Would you like me to also **add screenshots / badges** (like build passing, test coverage, report links) so the README looks more professional for GitHub?
